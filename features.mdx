## Overview

Tables Guru provides powerful tools to organize, collaborate on, and customize your documentation spaces. You create structured workspaces with folders, enable real-time collaboration, search efficiently, and tailor spaces to your needs. These features help teams maintain organized knowledge bases.

## Document Structuring and Folders

Organize your documentation hierarchically using folders and subfolders. You nest pages deeply for complex projects, with drag-and-drop reordering.

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Card title="Nested Folders" icon="folder" href="#">
    Create unlimited nesting levels to mirror your project structure.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bulk Operations" icon="layers" href="#">
    Move, rename, or delete multiple documents at once.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Page Templates" icon="file-text" href="#">
    Reuse templates for consistent documentation.
  </Card>
</Columns>

Visualize your structure:

    A[Workspace] --> B[Docs]
    A --> C[API]
    B --> D[Quickstart]
    B --> E[Guides]
    C --> F[Endpoints]
    C --> G[Auth]
```

## Collaboration and Version Control

Invite team members to collaborate in real-time. Changes track automatically with version history, allowing you to revert or compare versions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Invite Collaborators" icon="users">
    Share your space link or add emails via the members panel.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make Changes" icon="edit-3">
    Edit documents simultaneously—others see updates live.
  </Step>
  <Step title="View History" icon="git-branch">
    Access version history to restore previous states.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Compare versions programmatically:

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
  // Fetch version history
  const history = await fetch('https://api.tablesguru.com/spaces/{SPACE_ID}/history', {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}` }
  });
  const versions = await history.json();
  console.log(versions);
  ```
  ```python
  import requests

  response = requests.get(
      'https://api.tablesguru.com/spaces/{SPACE_ID}/history',
      headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {YOUR_API_KEY}'}
  )
  versions = response.json()
  print(versions)
  ```
</CodeGroup>
